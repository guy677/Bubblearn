# Bubblearn


BubbLearn 
trivia app, where I am fetching the question from Opentdb.
while the user got one or more quesitons wrong,
I am looking at my DB and searching for an answer for those questions,
if I dont have some answers I will search them in google(Using googleCustomeSearch),
save it in my DB and present it to the user.

also I am showing the user Graphs that will present him the categories whitch he strong at, 
an those he is weaker,and his secuss rate trough time.
